I want you to enhance my tasks so whenever the timer starts tracking something, the task status changes to in progress, Whenever I click on the checkmark to complete the task, it changes to complete. And whenever I just create the task and don't do anything, the task stays as not started. 

The to the mytasks tab on the dashboard improve the color coding and grouping to identify if it is a Freshly Created Task or a task that is In Progress (Completed tasks won't show up here)
