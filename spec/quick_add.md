# 'Quick Add' Button Fixes:

## 1.
When I create a new task and I start typing, the suggestions that show up block my ability to click save or to change the estimated time or priority of the task. Can you fix that? Even if I click out of the typing box, the suggestions still come up and block everything. 

## 2.
To add time I should also pick a task or have the ability to create a new one, but there should always be a task/project related to a time entry.

## 3.
Same error as #1 when adding a time entry
